/**
 * Chat layout spacing constants
 * 
 * These constants define the spacing between messages and the input area
 * to prevent overlap issues at the bottom of the chat panel.
 * 
 * ⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT TESTING
 * These values have been carefully tuned to prevent message/input overlap.
 * If you change ChatInputArea padding or MessageList padding, you MUST:
 * 1. Test with messages at the very bottom of the chat
 * 2. Test with both compact and normal modes
 * 3. Test with expanded input area (multiline input, file attachments)
 * 4. Update the comments below to document your changes
 */

/**
 * Extra spacing added to MessageList's paddingBottom beyond inputAreaHeight.
 * 
 * Why this value:
 * - ChatInputArea (non-compact) has pt-8 (32px) with 30% transparent gradient
 * - The transparent gradient area (~10px) can cause content to show through
 * - Additional 32px ensures visual breathing room and accounts for:
 *   - Gradient transition zone
 *   - Sub-pixel rounding differences
 *   - ResizeObserver timing delays
 * 
 * Formula: MessageList paddingBottom = inputAreaHeight + SAFE_BOTTOM_SPACING
 * 
 * History:
 * - Originally 16px: Caused overlap issues (reported multiple times)
 * - Changed to 32px: Provides reliable spacing buffer

 * 
 * DO NOT set lower than SAFE_BOTTOM_SPACING + 50px
