// FC runtime is Node 20, which has no native global WebSocket. supabase-js
// v2.45+ constructs a RealtimeClient inside createClient() (even when realtime
// is never used) and throws without a WebSocket transport. We never subscribe
// to channels here, but the constructor still runs — so pass `ws` to let it
// succeed (the socket is only opened lazily on an actual subscribe). Same
// workaround supabase-repo.mjs already applies for the /v1 client; without it
// the /sync/* handlers (which use this service-role client) failed with
// "Node.js 20 detected without native WebSocket support".
