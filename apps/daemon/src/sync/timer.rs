//! Autonomous 300s sync loop: covers the app-closed / headless case. The
//! desktop's HTTP trigger handles instant sync while the app is open.
//!
//! The workspace list is captured at spawn time. Teams added later are covered
//! immediately by the HTTP /v1/team/sync path, and re-captured on the next
//! daemon restart. (A live-refreshing timer is intentionally out of scope.)
