/// `RootTabView` in the AMUXUI package. This `@Observable` router bridges the two:
/// the receiver records a *pending* session intent here, and `RootTabView`
/// observes it, switches to the Sessions tab, and pushes the session onto its
/// path — then clears the intent so the next deep link to the same session fires
/// again.

/// It mirrors the existing `AppOnboardingCoordinator` pattern (an `@Observable`
/// `@MainActor` class injected via `.environment(...)`), so call sites stay
/// consistent with the rest of the app.
